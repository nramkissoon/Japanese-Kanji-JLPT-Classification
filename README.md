# Japanese Kanji JLPT Classification

This repository is provides data and code for running a classification system for Japanese kanji.

If Docker is already installed, executing the **run.sh** script will set up a container and install any dependencies 
needed to run the system. System output will be written to the **output_data/** directory, and the
docker container will be removed after the output has been written.

For a detailed look at the goals and design of the system, check out [this blog post](https://nramkissoon.github.io/kanji-difficulty-classification-system-design-document).
